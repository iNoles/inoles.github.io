  "about": "I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 9 years of industry experience, specializing in web, mobile, and cross-platform development. My journey in tech began in technical support and software testing, which gave me a strong foundation in quality, user empathy, and system reliability. Over the years, I've built and shipped products across platforms, working closely with teams to solve real-world problems with clean and efficient code. Outside of tech, I stay active through rock climbing and going to the gym. I'm always learning, always building, and always curious about what's next."
